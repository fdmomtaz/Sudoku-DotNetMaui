# .NET MAUI Sudoku Game

When thinking about platforms for creating mobile games, Unity and Unreal Engine often come to mind, with GameMaker being a popular choice for 2D games. However, .NET MAUI is also a great framework for developing cross-platform mobile games.

In this project, I created a Sudoku game using .NET MAUI. My goal was to develop a user-friendly and visually appealing Sudoku game that feels fun to play and looks awesome.

## Features

- Visually Appealing: Clean and attractive design to enhance user experience. (At least I think so! :) )
- Save: Save your progress and continue when you like.
- Hints and Tips: Get assistance when you are stuck.
